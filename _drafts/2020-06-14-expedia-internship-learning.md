Throughout the 10 weeks in our internship, we had sessions in which we learned more about engineering, testing, coding and leadership!
Below, I've written what I took out of these sessions; this is a long post, so maybe bring some :coffee:, sit down and enjoy :smile:.  
If you want to know more about my project. Read [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/internship/2020/06/17/expedia-internship-experience.html)

## Leadership Series
