I'm a third-year CSE student at [IIITD](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/), a Google Summer of Code 2019 [student](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2019/projects/6144888880496640/) under [VideoLAN](https://www.videolan.org/index.html) and an intern at Expedia for Summer 2020.

My expertise lies in Cloud (AWS,GCP,Spark,Vault), Frontend(Qt,HTML/CSS,Unity), Database (MongoDB, Elasticsearch, SQL, Logstash) and Deep Learning (mainly Computer Vision).

Here is my [Resume](https://rohanrajpal.github.io/blog/resume/Rohan_Resume.pdf).

### Notable Coursework at IIITD

### Engineering

Some of my coursework projects include:

- Implementing the Go-Back-N protocol in Python
- [Simulating a computer network](https://github.com/rohanrajpal/ns3_assignments) using ns-3 and evaluate its performance in C++
- Find [diseases in crops](https://zindi.africa/competitions/iclr-workshop-challenge-1-cgiar-computer-vision-for-crop-disease) using computer vision and deep learning techniques (Pytorch,Fastai).
- Find patterns in shallow clouds using satellite imagery using deep learning techniques (Pytorch,Fastai).
- Implementing [demand paging](https://github.com/rohanrajpal/CSE231-OS-Xv6-Assignment) in Xv6 in C
- Implementing [priority scheduling](https://github.com/rohanrajpal/CSE231-OS-Pintos) in Pintos in C
- Implement a [custom Linux shell](https://github.com/rohanrajpal/CSE231-OS-Shell-Assignment) using C
- Implementing a [Merkle tree](https://github.com/rohanrajpal/CSE231-OS-Merkle-Tree) in C
- Made a [replica](https://github.com/rohanrajpal/APGame) of the popular Snake Vs Block using Java and JavaFX

Independent projects:

- I wrote a [recommender system for movies](https://github.com/rohanrajpal/movie-recommender-system). Implemented user-user and item-item collaborative filtering in Python. Used Flask, Javascript to build the web app and deployed it to Heroku.
- Made a [mini-ERP system](https://github.com/rohanrajpal/ERPSystem), an Android app in Java using Firebase for handling the data

### Research

- Undergraduate Researcher, [Precog](http://precog.iiitd.edu.in/). The social computing lab of IIITD.
- Working on analyzing the social media data of an Indian app. Characterizing the role of the NaMo app in shaping political discourse on social media
- Fuzzy matching at scale, TF-IDF matrices cosine similarity, Elasticsearch

### Community and Leadership

I like contributing to the community, here's what I'm trying to do from my side:

- Lead and founder, [Developer Students Club](http://dsc.iiitd.edu.in/) of IIITD.
- Mentor, [Student Mentorship Programme](https://www.iiitd.edu.in/mentorprogram/):  
  - Mentoring 7 freshmen and helping them with their academic, social and personal issues.

### Questions and Answers

#### *Tell us about an accomplishment you're most proud of, and why it makes you proud*  

In my internship these summers, I worked in the cloud domain. My team was migrating from a legacy stack, and re-architecting for the cloud. My project involved building a spark job to sync data between different platforms.
I found the work to be quite overwhelming at the start. I didn't have much experience about technologies like Apache Spark, Hashicorp Vault, AWS. We also never really learnt much about scalability during college, so I had to learn about these concepts from scratch. However, I really wanted to learn more about the cloud and decided to give in my best. I delivered the proof of concept in just two weeks, and by the end of my internship, I had developed a scalable and secure production-level application.
I exceeded the expectations of my team and received excellent feedback about my work. I had come in with a straightforward aim for my eight-week internship; I wanted to ship industry-standard code. It was quite challenging, but I am proud that I achieved it.

#### *Tell us about a problem that frustrates you, and why it frustrates you*

I find it frustrating when people try to make money by offering interview prep courses at exorbitant prices just because they have worked at a tech giant or got admit in an ivy league college. I believe that quality education should be accessible to anyone for 10 dollars or less.
In our country, the situation is even worse. We all have to give an entrance exam to get into engineering colleges, and we get an admission solely on our rank on the test, nothing else. These exams are so competitive that people have set up coaching institutes which prepares students only for this single exam, starting as much as six years before the exam! The fees they charge for this is in multiples of the high school tuition fee. It's not fair to capitalize on the fear of students to not be able to get into a decent college.

#### *Tell us about a hack youâ€™ve built*

Many founders are scrappy and solve problems quickly with limited resources. What's a problem that you've encountered in your life where you've "hacked" together a physical, technical, or system-level solution?

When the pandemic started, everyone had to work from home. For corporates and schools, this meant a massive increase in VPN use, leading to slower internet speeds. I had to connect to a VPN almost every time, and the slow VPN speeds significantly affected browsing and video call experience. I just wanted a way I can use the VPN only for the server. So I finally figured out a way to selectively use VPN only for servers and use other applications without any restrictions. I shared my approach in a blog with my friends, and they found it quite useful, I have been using this split VPN approach ever since then.
